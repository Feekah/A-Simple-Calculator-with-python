#You need to create a simple calculator using GUI programing. 
#The graphical interface should allow the user to enter a number in a text field and either add it to or subtract it from a running total. 
#The running total should always be displayed. The user should be able to resit the running total to zero using a button Resit. 
#The user will need to input a new value and then either press the button “+” to add the value to the running total or press “-” button to decrement the value in the entry from the running total. Each time the buttons “+” or “-” are pressed, the entry will be cleared and the running total will be updated.
